This Cricket Team Selection App is a React-based application designed to let users build their own cricket team by selecting players, managing their budget, and experiencing a user-friendly interface based on a Figma design. The app allows users to explore a list of available cricket players, choose their desired players within a coin limit, and manage their selections efficiently. The application provides real-time feedback to users using React-Toastify for notifications, making it an engaging, interactive, and easy-to-use tool.

## Key Features

- **Budget Management:** Users manage a limited number of coins to choose their players, with real-time validation to ensure they donâ€™t overspend.
- **Player List Toggling:** Switch between available players and selected players with ease, providing a clear view of team-building progress.

- **Player Removal:** Players can be deselected from the team at any time, giving users the flexibility to change their team lineup.
